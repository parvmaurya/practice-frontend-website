# practice-frontend-website

This is the first website made by me. :)
The site is basically myself learning from various tutorials,
trying to combine it to make a somewhat complete looking website(it's a blob for now)
and using various concepts of Bootstrap and CSS.

The site will be updated and improved as I continue to learn 
more about Frontend Web Development.
The website may also include some Backend Functionalities in future. 

Tools Used: CSS, Bootstrap, JQuery, HTML
Setup Tools: Only a modern browser.
